# Horiseon

CHANGES MADE

1.) Change made within the title element within the head. Originally stated "website", changed it to "Horiseon Social Solution Services"
2.) The first div element with the class="header" was changed into a header element for semantic HTML. Also changed this within the CSS file.
3.) The div element containing the unordered list was changed into a nav element to clearly define that it is used as a navigation bar. I had to the div element into a nav element as well in the CSS file.
4.) The div element containing the class for the big image in the middle was changed into a img element and I have changed the class to be called "centerImg" for a more straightforward reading of the code. I had to change the class within the CSS file as well.
5.) The div element containing the main information taking up most of the page with three sections for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing was changed into a main element stating that it contains all the main information about the company.
6.) Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing were all divided by div elements within the main element, which I have changed all three into section elements to separate the each clearly to the reader of the code. This makes it easier to find  each section much faster. I have also added alt attributes to each image for each section respectively.
7.) The div element containing the the sections/boxes on the right side of the website was changed into an aside element in order to clearly separate and define this from the main element section of the website.
8.) Just like the main element section, I have changed each div element for Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management into section elements for easier accessibility for defining each section. I have also added alt attributes to each image in each section respectively for every image in the aside element.
9.) Finally I have changed the div element containing class="footer" into a footer element.
10.) I have also changed the h2 element within the footer into an h3 element.
11.) The only span element left within the code was the one located in the h1 element. I have tried multiple different elements to use rather than span and could not find a solution, even through Google.
